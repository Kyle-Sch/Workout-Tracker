Warmup with that speed or a slight-jogging pace for at least a minute, then begin your desired pace and time.

When finished, retract to the same speed you warmed up with for at least a minute or longer cooldown period.','true');

Begin at little to no resistance for at least a minute to get warmed up, and then increase to desired resistance for your workout. Retract to the same amount of resistance as your warmup for the cooldown when finished, also for at least a minute. Never let go of arm handles while pedaling','true');
INSERT INTO equipment VALUES ('Bench Press','Upper Body','false','benchpress.jpg','Place even amount of weight on each side of the bar, then secure them with clamps. Lay your back on the bench with your head towards the bar, and vertically line your neck up to about where the bar is (can adjust slightly for your own comfort, but this is generally the best placement form-wise). Always have a spotter standing directly behind the bar with their hands ready to assist you, if necessary. Lift bar straight up above its holder, and then out horizontally, directly above your chest (if it is a free-bar bench press, if it is a more guided machine, you usually have to lift the bar and rotate it slightly forward to release it from its holder). Lower the bar down until it just knicks your chest, but not to the point where your chest is supporting any of the weight. Then, lift the bar back up to the highest point BEFORE your elbows lock. Repeat this process until you are done with your reps, then notify your spotter that you are done. Allow them to assist you in placing the bar back into its holder.','true');
INSERT INTO equipment VALUES ('Hand Weights','Upper Body','false','handweights.jpg','Grab the weight directly in the middle of its bar, and maintain a firm grip. Consistently slow reps will do more for you than flying through it (as with any upper-body workout).','true');
INSERT INTO equipment VALUES ('Leg Press','Lower Body','false','legpress.jpg','Place weights on bar just as you would with the bench press, and clamp them. Sit with back straight on the seat and not slouching. Place feet directly in the middle of the press about shoulder length apart. Push weight past its holders and then turn the handles of the holders outward to release them. Grab on to the seat handles, and bring legs as close to your chest as possible without resting the weight on it. Then, push back out to the farthest point BEFORE locking your knees. Repeat the process until you finish your reps. On the last outward push, turn holders back inward and rest the press on them.','true');
